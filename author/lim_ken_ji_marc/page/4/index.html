	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Le Quang Anh (17-U3)</strong> is a passionate learner, whose excellence in Mathematics and other subjects was an inspiration to his peers. His avid interest in Mathematics was evident in the long list of competitions he took part in and most notably in the Commendation Award at the Singapore International Mathematics Competition, Silver Award at the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad, attaining the Honour Roll certificate at the American Mathematics Competition and clinching 3rd place wit his team at the Shanghai TI Cup 2017. His curiosity in Economics and the sciences could be seen in his involvement in EColumnist, a student-driven writing programme, and his participation in the Young Defence Scientists Programme in 2017. The research he completed gave him the opportunity to present at two further conferences.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">I feel very satisfied and happy with the results I received. It was not only the fruit of my labour, but also that of my teacher, my parents, my friends and the staff at EJC. For me personally it could not have been achieved without consistent self-revision, of paying rapt attention during every lecture and tutorial, and asking for help from teachers and friends whenever I was in doubt, especially for my weaker subjects. I feel thankful for being put through the continuous process of school tests and exams which keep me working and retaining information, effectively dividing and conquering that scary monster called the A-Level exams. My parents and the EJC staff were my source of moral support, who were willing to listen and help.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">I could not imagine having been as happy being anywhere else but Eunoia for my JC years. To be very honest, there was somewhat an uncertainty when I applied for EJC as my very first choice during JAE, but the two years here has dispelled all of that. The journey has been a rewarding process of building something new, of exploring and of growing together as a community, thanks to the many friends who backed me up along the way, and the teachers and staff who were willing to listen to our stories and give their encouragements and guidance. The culture of showing care and empowering student voice was indispensable in this journey. There is probably no JC in Singapore where a CG can have a fish in their homeroom as a class pet!</span></p>

"Do not be shy to find help or provide help" would be my first advice. In times of crisis (e.g. nearing the exams), talking to a teacher or a good friend really helped to keep on going. My second advice would be to be consistent in their academic work. "Pay attention in lectures, and if necessary, drink lots of water to stay awake" is my second advice. Although the second part of the advice may be different from person to person (some chemistry students may argue that drinking water reduces concentration!), trying to follow and understand the content in lectures would save us a lot of time at home completing the tutorial, and very often, the teachers share tips and experience that do not come from the notes. Lastly, for the JC1s especially, "Be not afraid to try out new things and pursue your passions!" because exploration and building new things is something we all can do.</span></p>

His dedication naturally placed him on the Dean's List (Academic) in both years and the Commendation Award for Further Mathematics. His passion for learning saw him take on H3 Mathematics and participate in the Singapore Physics Olympiad and the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad; the effort he put in paid off in Silver medals for both olympiads in both years. Furthermore, he was instrumental in his team's Bronze medals at the Singapore Young Physicists Tournament in 2017 and 2018. An active member of the Computing &amp; Robotics Club, he represented the college in the DSTA Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp in 2017 and clinched Bronze with his team. Julian is also passionate about serving the community, volunteering at Fostering Affection Towards Elderly (FATE) where he helped organise events for Lions Befrienders in 2017 and 2018.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">An interest in learning and time management is what enabled me to achieve these results. You would probably not like many subjects that you are taking in JC. However, every subject can be interesting if you go deep enough. During JC1 when I had relatively more time, I asked questions that challenged my understanding even if I did not really enjoy the subject. Such questions can be interesting to pursue even if you do not get the full answer, as they would deepen your knowledge and skill for the subject matter. With regards to time management, small pockets of time such as time waiting for the bus are useful to do something productive. I scheduled my rest time to keep my rest time in check. Also, paying attention and making full use of lecture time really decreases your load after school.</span></p>

In EJ, I have met the most wonderful teachers in my life, and they played a big part in shaping who I am today. I won’t name all of them because there are too many! I am touched by their concern for the students. They answer questions posed by students late in the night, and work way over time! I am inspired by their approaches to life and teaching. Their guidance helped me gain a direction in life and to pursue academic excellence.</span></p>

Their passion added much to college culture: Muchen wrote a voting application for his junior cohort's cardboard challenge and an application that allocated concurrent sessions to his peers based on their preference, while Jackson conducted engaging lessons on Python, Cryptography and Arduino for his peers at various college events. In addition, Jackson and Muchen represented the college in their areas of passion.

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Jackson: </strong>My 2 years in Eunoia has been filled with much uncertainty but was ultimately a fulfilling one. Being part of Computing and Robotics club exco team, I had the opportunity to help lay out the groundwork for the new CCA. Without the foresight and guidance of seniors, we had to rely on our own judgement to decide what was best for the CCA, making our work especially stressful. Nevertheless, I was fortunate to be part of an extremely motivated exco team who work tirelessly together and stuck with one another through thick and thin. Seeing the CCA flourishing and being safely passed down to the next batch at the end of my exco term really gives me a great sense of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The 2 years in Eunoia also gave me much room to pursue my passion in Physics and had thus been extremely intellectually satisfying. Through participation in physics competitions such as the Singapore Young Physicists Tournament and Singapore Physics Olympiad, I had the chance to delve deep into challenging concepts and problems that opened me up to a wealth of knowledge. My teachers around me were very supportive of my endeavours, which provided me with great motivation to continue with my pursuit amidst the hectic JC life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Muchen:</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 20px;">My two years in Eunoia have been a roller coaster of emotions. I was a complete stranger to everyone and not willing to mingle with people other than the people I was familiar with in secondary school. But I slowly got to know my classmates and opened up. I found that I actually wanted to come to school and talk to my newfound friends. So… Anh and Cedric made the journey meaningful for me. </span><span style="font-size: 20px;">Although the second year was more hectic as everyone rushed to study, it was still a blast with all my friends. Teachers such as Mr David Hoe and Dr Chen Weiqiang made it more meaningful as I get to understand some concepts on a deeper level, displacing the habit of route learning that everyone thought studying was going to be. This made studying more insightful as everything became connected and I was able to generate a bigger picture of everything around me. So, I am really grateful for all these people that made the fast-paced and challenging life in JC worthwhile.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Muchen:</strong> To all my juniors, treasure the moments you have with your peers as you support each other through the last years of formal education. Just enjoy the journey you have while studying to make it a more meaningful one. Help your peers around you and never be shy to make new friends and get support from the people around you- your friends, teachers, and family. You have great teachers here to guide you through JC, you just have to reach out to them. Jiayou for your As, and never lose hope as the finish line is right around the corner. All the best!</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Our second cohort of Eunoians received their A-Level Project Work results on 16 Apr 2019 and have charted the way forward for the college and for themselves with their excellent performance. </span><span style="font-size: 20px;">Ms Adrienne de Souza, Head of Department (Project Work &amp; Flagship Programmes) said, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">"The 2018 cohort has performed tremendously. They learned to collaborate, pitch their ideas, negotiate them and express them beautifully, all while discovering and appreciating each other's strengths. They have proven that Project Work is about connecting the mind and heart, and bringing courage towards their purpose. In future, I hope that our Eunoians will use the skills they have learned in Project Work to solve real problems, and help make our communities, our country and our world a better place for all."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">To map our Eunoians' growth, we interviewed three more groups of students from 18-I1, 18-O2 and 18-I3 to learn more about their experience, the purpose they found and the connections they made along the way.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solomon Chua</strong>: We chose to focus on the issue of foster care in Singapore, or more specifically, the lack of foster parents willing to foster older children (aged 11-17). I am personally invested in this issue as my family is involved in the foster care system which has exposed me to the problems foster children face as they grow up. As such, I felt that foster care would be a meaningful topic to pursue and I’m glad that my group mates felt the same way as I did.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tan Wen Xin</strong>: Our PW journey was very meaningful as it allowed me to put myself into the shoes of foster parents and understand the issue from their perspectives, as well as other related stakeholders, which I would not have gotten to experience otherwise. While this journey of ours has been extremely enriching as we carried a ‘Practice till Perfection'</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentality and the spirit of excellence, my biggest takeaway would be the feeling of 4 other amazing individuals that became a group of people that I am most comfortable with. From the moment we left the exam hall, our group knew that the results don’t matter as much as the journey we had, simply because the journey had been a most fulfilling one for us. </span></p>

We really reflected a lot and put ourselves in the shoes of foster parents at this phase of the project as we cannot merely come up with a solution that is convenient for us. We needed to consider the perspectives of our target group. I also have a newfound respect for foster parents as despite it being a thankless job, they are persevering on.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Zoelynn Wong</strong>: Looking back, the most vivid memories I could think of were, firstly, the whole process of filming the short introduction video for our slides together, and secondly slaving through our written report at 7pm in F1-11 during PW ASAP that one time after we, all of us together, procrastinated, forgot to do and subsequently did subpar work in our written report, disappointing our PW tutor. One memory showed me how fun it was actually to work on something with my PW group mates, the other memory taught me that success comes only from discipline and hard work. Both memories, however, taught me the value of friendship within a team, even if your team consists of people you don’t talk to normally, who aren’t necessarily in your “clique”. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Freya Keertikar</strong>: To be frank, a lot of the memories that I have of the entire PW process have been a blur because it all happened so fast and yet I can still remember every single emotion that we felt, be it disappointment when our work did not meet expectations or the joy and satisfaction we felt when we finished our Oral Presentation and knew that it was the best we could have ever done. To me, all these experiences taught be the power of being a collective, because every single one of these emotions was felt by every single one of us and we shared our burdens, managing to ride this rollercoaster together. It was something that we hardly ever experience in our lifetimes and the entire PW process truly taught me that being in a group isn’t just about looking out for yourself, it’s about facing together and living up to the spirit of ‘All for one, and one for all’. We entered the group as just classmates, but at the end of the day, we came out as true friends tied by a shared experience and that is a phenomenon that is hard to ever recreate. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Joey Lim</strong>: Our project was about children aged 1-6 drowning in Singapore’s condominium private pools. We created a 3 prong approach to help overcome this crisis tackling the issue from various perspectives. Originally, our group was put together because we were the ones in the class that came up with weird ideas that did not fit with the others. Ranging from helping construction workers spines to dental health, we had the difficult task of narrowing down what crisis we wanted to tackle. One of our group members was actually a licensed lifeguard and suggested doing a project on children drowning in Singapore. After doing a bit of research and watching horrifying videos of children drowning silently with their guardians right beside them, it greatly concerned many of us in the group as most of us had younger siblings that we could picture as the drowning child. Hence, we decided to go with what we were most passionate about and tackle the growing crisis of children drowning in Singapore.</span></p>

For instance, I learnt to make more insightful deductions and evaluations of the project and the problem through the I&amp;R segment, and to assess the reliability of sources through the WR. I also learnt to appreciate and empathise with the issues which minorities face which are largely kept under the radar by society. Furthermore, I also learnt that pre-existing solutions can be a template for us to derive meaningful learning points, which can lay the foundation for future solutions in a wide range of subjects. Most importantly, I learnt to appreciate the limits of collaboration in the form of conflicts of opinions and schedules, and how to challenge those limits by utilising each other’s strengths. </span></p>

Personally, I had always preferred to work alone as I find it to be more efficient and quicker way of solving problems. However, through working with my group mates, I realised that even though we weren’t on the same page all the time and though we weren’t the most efficient bunch of people, the process of formulating solutions for complex and abstract problems and more importantly, seeing the group, grow and progress as one, was something which was a hundred times more meaningful and rewarding than going on the journey alone. As cliche as it may sound, I guess PW made be truly realise the saying of ‘if you want to go fast go alone; if you want to go far go together’ and I really appreciate my group mates for making my PW journey something worth remembering. </span></p>

I learnt to actively seek out answers and to be intellectually curious about things around me. Through this, I acquired many skills such as integrating and applying knowledge from different sources to evaluate ideas. This developed my problem solving skills and taught me to think creatively in order to generate ideas to improve on existing solutions. Although working closely as a group was tough at the start, after getting to know one another better, we were able to confidently speak out minds, compromise and work off our individual strengths towards a common goal. Not only did I acquire various useful skills such as collaboration, but I also learnt how to communicate ideas effectively to an audience. We had to pitch our ideas verbally during our OP and through the written form via our WR. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Vera Lee</b>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that made PW meaningful for me was finding out the issues my batchmates had chosen to tackle for their various projects. By simply asking my friends what the gist of their project was, or listening to them memorising and reciting their OP scripts, I was exposed to many issues in society that have yet to be addressed, which allowed me to learn more about the impact of these significant problems on our daily lives that I previously would not have considered. However, more importantly, I learnt to appreciate my group’s collaborative effort to produce a piece of work that we would be proud to present at the end of the year. I appreciate that every member of this team understood from the beginning that we had to make the effort to voice our opinions, meet deadlines and contribute equally in order to pull it off. Over our time spent together, they taught me to communicate more effectively, to become a better listener and to think out of the box. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Joey Lim</strong>: The most useful thing I learnt was how to be resourceful. As a lifeguard, I had actual contacts that I could consult in order to gain new insights or ideas on how to modify our project. In the beginning I was very hesitant about contacting them choosing instead to rely on research online or from the lifeguard booklet. However some things that you need to learn are just not able to be found on text but rather you need to actually sit down with someone who has experienced it and talk to them. So, after my lifeguard trainings, I would take half an hour to talk to my lifeguard coach, trying to gain new insights. I would go up to parents who sent their 1-7 year olds for swimming lessons and ask them questions. At first, I was sure that they would ignore me but as the saying goes, “you never know unless you try”. The people I interacted with were actually very open to sharing whatever information they knew and were really interested in the project that we were doing. My lifeguard coach even lent us his Mini Annie (A CPR training dummy) to use during our Oral Presentation. So at the end of the day, I learnt to use whatever resources I had to its fullest, be grateful when you do receive help from strangers and to never think that something is impossible until you try it yourself.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Elijah Chia</strong>: I believe that the most important criterion in determining PW success is preparation. This extends to all segments of PW. Have as many rounds of vetting of your WR and I&amp;R and as possible, constantly refer to an assortment of model WRs to elicit possible areas of improvement, rehearse your OP frequently, and create a question bank which is as big as possible. These preparations lay the foundation for any possible criticisms you may encounter during the actual marking of your PW. In addition, learn to collaborate with those outside your group as well; share question banks with other groups in order to obtain a wider range of questions.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Joey Lim</strong>: Honestly there is a hundred and one things that I would tell my juniors to look out for. But the most important thing I would say is to set deadlines. Regardless of if they are short deadlines, spanning a week, or long deadlines, spanning a term, always have a goal that you set for yourself and your team. Project Work is a marathon. If you aimlessly try to get through the year without setting any deadlines on what to complete, you will ultimately be as lost as you will feel. Always write down what needs to be done, changed or rewritten. Assign it specifically to your members and try to set a meeting with your teammates at the end of the week via an actual meetup or skype so that its a pseudo checkpoint that forces you and your teammates to complete the work you have to do. Personally, my group had at least 4 long term lists of deadlines and more than 8 short term lists that we followed. In each one we listed down what work we need to prioritise and what would be an added bonus to have if we could implement it in. This helped to not only make sure our work was completed without conflicting with our exams, but also helped us set an agenda for our meetups so that we know what we have to discuss and actually manage to sleep at a decent time.  </span></p>

We did this through roadshows, animations and games to inform members of the public, especially youth, the dangers of misinformation and how to prevent it. We chose this project because we found it prevalent in our society today. Social media is one of the fastest ways to spread and share information - as well as fake news. By identifying youths aged 15-24 as the largest and most active group on social media such as WhatsApp and Instagram, we can therefore spread awareness of misinformation to people with the highest exposure to it.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nicole Tan</strong>: Although at first it may seem like there is a lot of time to meet deadlines, time really flies by! Don’t procrastinate and try to plan ahead and stay on task. Also, from the start try not to let your word count build up. Make your drafts concise, with only the relevant information put in as having to cut down on words towards the end of your project is an arduous task. Overall, know that you’re not alone in this journey and don’t be afraid to approach your teachers, seniors, or other group members for help. Believe in yourselves!</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">"The 2018 cohort has performed tremendously. They learned to collaborate, pitch their ideas, negotiate them and express them beautifully, all while discovering and appreciating each other's strengths. They have proven that Project Work is about connecting the mind and heart, and bringing courage towards their purpose. In future, I hope that our Eunoians will use the skills they have learned in Project Work to solve real problems, and help make our communities, our country and our world a better place for all."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">To map our Eunoians' growth, we spoke to three groups of students from 18-U1, 18-I5 and 18-I6 to learn more about their experience, the purpose they found and the connections they made along the way.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Su Thet Htar San:</strong> Our project was about Sleep Deprivation in teenagers, especially those in Junior Colleges. We had a difficult time selecting a project that was both relevant to our context as well as appealing to us, having switched from many different topics that ranged from the issue of Pink Tax to the over-usage of cell phones. In the end, we chose to tackle sleep deprivation as it was an issue that was close to home and close to our hearts, being fresh in our mind after seeing all our bleary-eyed peers and hearing all the sleep-loss horror stories.</p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Grace Cheu</strong>: Our PW journey was meaningful because our group worked on sleep deprivation in youths, which we closely relate to, and studying this issue allowed us to gain insights that we could apply or identify in our own daily lives relating to sleeping habits and our lifestyles. It also made us to want to improve our own personal sleeping habits as well after finding out so much more about the causes and effects relating to sleep deprivation. The journey was also made a lot more meaningful with the support and our group members had for one another. It was really heartening to see us caring for one another and stepping up to fill up gaps in instances where some of us might have been struggling with more commitments that particular week.</p>

What made out PW journey extremely meaningful and unique to me was how lucky I was to have teammates who were caring, creative and hardworking- brainstorming for fresh solutions and doing endless research for every new problem we found were chores made enjoyable because of these friends. Furthermore, as we shared our solution with peers and teachers alike, we were extremely heartened by the enthusiastic responses elicited, and grew in passion towards refining it and presenting our project in the best way possible. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah-Ann Tan:</strong> My PW journey was really enriching because of the arsenal of skills I have acquired and honed which have enabled me to grow holistically. Through working on the various group components with my team, for example, I have learnt that a team thrives through capitalizing on one another’s strengths, while having a set of common goals, interests and values which welds the group together given our differences. I have also witnessed the power of confidence and positivity in influencing a team’s dynamics — their contagious nature inevitably galvanises the team to follow suit. I think one of the reasons why my team never saw the need to appoint a leader was because we saw how one another’s enthusiasm and conviction spontaneously empowered and inspired the rest of the team. To conclude, while it was the learning experience that made my journey enriching, most importantly, I thoroughly enjoyed my PW journey for it was the people I worked most closely with who made it absolutely fruitful and meaningful! @isabel @grace @htar &lt;33</span></p>

Before passing the boarding gate, passengers are required to empty their bottles. Most of the time, passengers will simply throw away their excess water, which will eventually accumulate as Singaporeans travel a lot. Our group chose to pursue this project as we also travel a lot and will sometimes feel guilty when we throw away our excess water as it poses severe consequences. Thus, our group has a common goal of reducing water wastage in Changi Airport, which drives us to pursue this project.</span></p>

Having a good teacher is not the be all and end all, the entire PW journey requires the efforts of both the teacher and the group. Make sure you are always on task, ready for consults and don’t waste the time that your teacher gives you during consults. Respect the teacher’s effort and time and she/he will do the same. Even when it seems as if the consult is pointless and repetitive, your teacher will have words of advice to impart to you so really make the most of the time you have!</span></p>

Two members of our group picked up this issue for the first individual presentation and piqued the interest of the rest of the members and ultimately, we chose to pursue this project as we realised the severity of the situation in Singapore. One would expect the citizens living in a developed country like Singapore to practise responsibility when taking up the duty of caring for another life. Yet, despite the increasing number of animal shelters and welfare groups in Singapore, there is still an increasing shortage of space and manpower. This realisation that the situation was worsening beneath the surface was simply appalling.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nicholas Goh</strong>: Throughout your PW journey, as important as it is for members to have differing opinions, it is just as important for you and your group members to cooperate effectively. While conflict at times cannot be avoided, do try your best to view the other perspectives instead of instantly rejecting them and take your time to resolve these issues before moving on. Another important thing to note is to have a base plan of the data that you are planning to collect, as collecting the data you need in one go will allow your group to focus on the written components. Otherwise, it may hinder your group later on as more time is needed to collect the data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Allow me to begin by going back in time. In October 2016, our Mount Sinai campus saw its first glimpse of student life at a gathering of our then-Year 4 Joint Integrated Programme students. The assortment of colours grew when we welcomed our Eunoians from the Joint Admissions Exercise in February 2017 to complete our first class of students. So much of the college, from the cheers that reach our neighbours in Ghim Moh to the ineffable pride that has reached deep into our third cohort, started from those incipient meetings. It felt almost strange in the first weeks of the year to <em>not </em>see the familiar faces of our pioneering cohort each morning, studying at the Atria benches, painting banners or running around the campus.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The hall and canteen at our Mount Sinai campus reside in a block we have named Concordia. The Latin word means harmony, translating literally to ‘with heart’. It is perhaps apt that we welcomed some members of our first class – whom we can now call our alumni – in the heart of our school at a few points in Term 1. The campfire at our Orientation finale burned stronger with our past student councillors and orientation group leaders watching on. Some of them also joined us to <em>lou hei </em>at our Chinese New Year Celebrations. Just the day before the release of the A-Level results, many more came back with strong hands and big hearts to help us pack goodie bags full of higher education and scholarship collaterals for their own batchmates. After the results were released, we saw many Eunoians return to the college once again with gifts and cards to thank their teachers. The joy at seeing our alumni come back goes together with seeing their passion and thoughtfulness after they have left the college. We thank our alumni for keeping Eunoia close to their hearts and minds and hope to see many more of them return home, whether at our current campus or in Bishan.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The day the A-Level results were released gave us very many reasons for celebration. Seeing our ladies and gentlemen, some in uniform and clean heads, a little more mature with three months’ worth of adventures and work experience under their belt was one. Another was their stellar academic performance as a cohort, both a capstone to their all-round achievement and contributions as pioneers and a milestone for the Eunoia community. Their stories of resilience, from overcoming personal and social challenges, confronting their fears and mistakes, and working together with their peers and teachers, will inspire their juniors and a full generation ahead of them. Their can-do spirit is a part of the Eunoia DNA. We now know that every Eunoian has the potential to shine in the sporting arena, the performance stage, community engagement and academic pursuits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">With even brighter paths ahead of them, we remain keenly interested in their growth after junior college: our gentlemen will set purposeful milestones in national service, and our Eunoians will be receiving offers from universities and scholarship boards. We have been elated to learn that many are likely to take on courses they are passionate about locally and in Peking, Oxford, King’s, Imperial, UCL, Virginia amongst many other overseas institutions. To our first alumni, let’s keep in touch and do come back to share your experiences with your juniors!</span></p>

The finale at our open house, where hundreds gathered at our Atria for a rapturous batch dance, particularly made our hearts sing and our eyes water a little. At Eunite and EJC Orientation, we saw our second cohort of students stepping up with youthful purpose, heart and courage to lead our JC1 Eunoians. Behind the games, races and cheers, our student-leaders and orientation group leaders have put in a remarkable amount of effort and thought, and we imagine that this experience, igniting the fire within their juniors and themselves, stay with them and push them to shine in their 2019 journey.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The fruit of their labour is already presenting itself. News of our Aesthetics groups and athletes’ achievements at the Singapore Youth Festival and National School Games is coming in week by week, a culmination of their intensive rehearsals and training alongside their scholastic preparations for the JC2 March Common Test and continual assessment for our JC1s. Just as important are the strong friendships they build and the memories they forge during the toughest of periods. Even as juniors and seniors look to each other for possibilities and direction, let them remember that the obstacles they encounter and the difficulties they work through will help them grow into bigger, braver versions of themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Taking on the mantle as seniors, our JC2s can be confident of themselves and their contributions to the world around them. Our Global Orientation Programme in 2018 gave them the opportunity to explore and immerse themselves in new communities in China, Taiwan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. It is our desire that they regard service to others as a part of their daily life. At our most recent Deep Dive Day, our entire cohort embarked on different service projects in Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Admiralty, Punggol and Ghim Moh, and their interactions with our senior citizens would have given them much to cherish and learn. This being our last year situated at Mount Sinai, we hope to see our Eunoians continue giving back to the neighboring Ghim Moh community and find meaning in doing so.</span></p>

Mr Adrian Tay joined us as Deputy Principal at the end of 2018, having served stints at the Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education and led as a pioneering Head of Department at Crest Secondary School. Our third cohort of students, already invigorated in their houses and civics groups from their Orientation, will soon be taking up leadership responsibilities and take the college to greater heights. The construction of our Bishan campus too has been progressing steadily, with the academic block nearing completion. Our architects have presented to us some of the spaces our Eunoians will be able to learn, train and interact in. Drive past Marymount Road or take a walk at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, and you will have a good view of the possibilities that await us. We hope to share with you more photos of the campus from the inside as soon as we can.</span></p>

This joint performance by our five Aesthetics CCA groups – the Eunoia Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Dance, Drama and Symphonic Band – is accompanied by several more of our talented Eunoians’ artwork and musical items. We invite you to join us at the University Cultural Centre Hall on 11 May 2019 as well as our Funfair and Unconference at our Mount Sinai campus on 20 July 2019.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The next term promises to be a most exciting and intense one for our Eunoians, as the Singapore Youth Festival and National School Games seasons kick in and progressively higher academic demands come their way. With your continued support, may they light the way forward as leaders, thinkers and youth with purpose.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Isabel Chan Jia Yi (17-O1)</strong> is a Ministry of Education (MOE) Humanities Scholar. A dedicated learner and writer, she was placed on the Dean's List (Academic) and was the top student for H2 Geography in the cohort for both 2017 and 2018. Highly driven and all-rounded, Isabel exhibited strong leadership as a Student Councillor and the Vice-Captain of the Hockey (Girls) team. As the overall IC, she rallied her team of councillors to successfully organise the college's first Teachers' Day Celebrations. Her passion, tenacity and discipline brought the Hockey team together, who emerged as 1st runners-up in the 'A' Division Championships in 2018. Isabel also showed great initiative and care for the community, participating in a Values-in-Action project at Gracehaven, embarked on a campaign with World Vision's 'My Vision' programme to raise funds for worldwide access to education, and laid the ground for the college's Community Mapping programme in Ghim Moh. Isabel's legacy is evident for all to see - she is one of two student-designers behind the college's white and grey pin-striped uniform.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Tan Zi Hao (17-U1) </b>is an exemplary learner and a generous friend whose commitment, organisational skills and spirit of inquiry stand out amongst his many qualities. As part of the college's Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) class, he served as a HSP ambassador advising his juniors on the programme and their subject combination choices. His passion for History and International Relations inspired him to take on a H3 Geopolitics module on the Geographies of War and Peace at the National University of Singapore and take part in the 8th ASEAN Quiz with two classmates. Together they emerged champions at the national level and represented Singapore regionally in December 2018. As a founding member of EJC Drama, he was versatile as an actor and scriptwriter, contributing in both capacities for the group's original production at the Official College Opening. On top of his creative and intellectual aptitude, he was forthcoming in supporting his classmates who faced challenges in Mathematics. </span></p>

Ever vibrant yet calmly measured, her brimming love for the humanities saw her participate in the National Geography Talent Development Programme in 2017. In her role as a pioneering student councillor in the Culture unit, she was pivotal in conceptualising Euphoria, an islandwide race that culminated in a beach party at Sentosa for the JC1 cohort in 2017. Her remarkable optimism and grit were also seen in her involvement in the 'A' Division Netball Championship and various netball tournaments, as well as her leadership in the Netball CCA's blood donation drive. Amidst her heavy commitments, Jelita pursued her passion in music with her performances at numerous college events. Most notably, Jelita is one of two student performers who gave voice to our college anthem at its inauguration, the Official Opening ceremony and the college's first Graduation Ceremony. In addition, she wrote and performed a song as an expression of her gratitude on Teachers' Day. A talented youth, confident thinker and passionate leader, Jelita is a natural candidate for the EAGLES award and an embodiment of #EunoiaShining.</span></p>

An exceptional student and critical thinker who offered H3 History and H2 Knowledge &amp; Inquiry, she frequently went beyond the confines of the classroom, counting a job shadowing internship with MOE, her presentation at the inaugural Humanities Scholarship Programme symposium and her role as an emcee for the OnePeople.sg Model United Nations in 2017. With diligence and humility, Audrey placed on the Dean's List (Academic) in 2017 and 2018, receiving top honours for Knowledge &amp; Inquiry, Literature in English and History.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"> Furthermore, her sharp intellect earned her the Outstanding Delegate Award at the 2017 Model Middle East Summit and led her team the second runner-up at the NUS Students' Political Association (NUSPA) Chancellor's Challenge Shield. As President of the Debate Society, she represented the college as its main speaker in a long list of ten competitions and led her executive committee to build a CCA that goes beyond results to give back to society. The epitome of an all-rounded student, Audrey volunteered at Meet-the-People sessions in the Toa Payoh East-Novena ward, and used her writing skills to give a voice to patients under the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Home Ventilation Programme.</span></p>

Awarded the MOE Humanities Scholarship, he pursued his love for learning in multiple seminars, symposia and ministerial dialogues and undertook a H3 History independent research essay on the shifting historiographies of the Sino-Soviet split. As a pioneering Student Councillor and an Executive Committee member of the Outdoor Adventure Club (ODAC), he made immense contributions in the Welfare and Communications units: initiating and managing a college-wide student forum, recruiting the first cohort of Student Ambassadors, overseeing the carnival segment for the college's Official Opening and organising training activities for his fellow members and juniors in ODAC. His love for the outdoors saw him participate and attain a bronze at the EW Barker Challenge in 2017. Effectively bilingual, he assisted at several Meet-the-People sessions at Toa Payoh East Community Centre, drafting letters of appeal and providing support for residents. Above all, Jeff's concern for his peers and community and his work ethic have left a deep, positive impression on his peers and teachers.</span></p>

Alongside her aptitude for computational thinking, her passion for the humanities fuelled her participation in the 2017 Raffles Asia Programme Symposium, the 2017 Agricultural Forum and the 2018 NUS Geographical Society Essay Competition. As EJC Hockey's quarter mistress and Class Chairperson in 2018, Belle was a meticulous coordinator and exemplary leader who encouraged and edified her classmates with an open mind and perceptive mind. Without any prior experience in Hockey, she stepped into the role of goalkeeper for the team, which emerged runners-up in the 2018 'A' Division Championships. Amidst these commitments, Belle actively sought to serve the community, connecting her batchmates with Ghim Moh residents in the college's first Orientation, serving at Meet-the-People sessions at Ulu Pandan GRC and volunteering as a steward at the True Colours Festival. Truly, Belle is a resilient, decisive and driven leader of people.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Caspian Ng (17-I1)</strong> is a steadfast leader, thinker and Eunoian in every respect. As the pioneering captain of Track &amp; Field, he shouldered the responsibility of forging a strong team identity and laid the foundation for training and management. Finishing with a Gold medal in the 400m hurdles at the 'A' Division Track &amp; Field Championships in 2018, he represented the Singapore Schools Track &amp; Field team at the 10th ASEAN School Games held in Kuala Lumpur. Caspian was also a Student Councillor, who oversaw the creation and distribution of the college's distinctive sports team jackets. As the House Vice-Captain for Isami, he led efforts to bring his house together and excel at college events. Perceptive, energetic and a natural leader, he never failed to encourage and inspire his peers in and outside the classroom.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The first word that comes to mind is 'torturous'. It is an ordeal because you have to sit down for hours at a time reading stacks of notes and you have to just keep working, keep writing, keep completing assignments, keep finishing extra homework for consultations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">But it was also very fulfilling because of the unprecedented amount of effort and attention I put into my studies, and through that, I really, really learned a lot. My teachers told me in JC2 that they saw a very marked improvement in my performance and telling me that regardless of the outcome, they were proud of the progress I made. So it was really fulfilling to know that you are breaking your own barriers, and it is the journey of learning you go through not just for yourself, but for and with the friends and teachers alongside you.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Apart from my studies, I took on multiple leadership positions and a heavy involvement in Track and Field. The month of March in my JC2 was one of the biggest challenges when I had all my commitments clashing, tight timelines and still the great destination of the A-Level Examination ahead. That was probably the period when I felt the most frazzled, drained and sometimes even despairing. When I looked at myself, there were moments I started to doubt myself and wondered if I overestimated myself. It was a journey in which I hit very high 'highs', but also some very bad 'lows'. Even though it was draining, sacrificing a lot along the way, I started to think back about the purpose of why I started each involvement, why I started my journey, and it gave me the strength to pull through.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">I believe that at the end of it, I turned out to be a better person because of my choices. It was tough, but it shaped me to be who I am today and I don't think many experiences can compare to that.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Seck Li-lyn (17-E1)</strong> is an accomplished student, artist and leader who has left a legacy in Eunoia in several ways. Placed on the Dean's List (Service &amp; Leadership), Li-lyn's humility, perseverance and passion earned her the respect of her peers. An outstanding Art student who attained distinctions in H2 and H3 Art, Li-lyn's entry for the UOB Painting of the Year (2018) was featured in the Singapore Youth Festival 2018 Art Exhibition. With a fellow Art student, she co-designed a LEGO mural to commemorate the college's inaugural graduation ceremony.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">As the student conductor and section leader in the EJC Choir, she contributed significantly to the development of the CCA in its formative years. Truly a pioneer, she designed the Choir's performance costume, notice board and tickets for its inaugural concert. The elegant gowns and suits the choristers were the product of her resourcefulness and willingness to take criticism in stride. Dauntless, resilient and creative, Li-lyn has left a lasting impression on the Eunoia community, her teachers and peers.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">I entered Eunoia with average O-Level results and I honestly did not think that I would be able to do well at the start. My friends were the one driving force through it all. They were ready to support me all the way and because many of them had a very strong will and drive to excel, they pulled me from many episodes of self-doubt. Seeing everyone trying their best motivated me to try my best too. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">There are many others who have been very important as well - a shout-out to Mr Timothy Ng, the best General Paper teacher ever! I'm very grateful to all my teachers, including my Geography teacher Mrs Kellie Woo and CT Mr Ng, for showing a lot of care and concern to all their students. Apart from academic grades, I think they drove us to see our dreams and aspirations, and really took time to sit down with us and talk to us about where we wanted to go after the A-Levels. I think that really helped us because we are sometimes so focused on results that we do not see the big picture. They really are there to sharpen our vision and help us get back. </span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">My first piece of advice would be to pace yourself. There will be many a time when you are highly motivated and want to give it your all, but you may burn out. Learning to know when and how to take things lightly is quite important. It is important to surround yourself with a group of like-minded friends who will strive with you. JC isn't just about academic success - it may seem like it at times, but you can really accomplish so much more if you look outside your bubble.</span></p>

As Class Chairperson, she led her class with equal parts heart and finesse. As a member of the college's Chinese Orchestra, she honed her skills quickly to play the cello with confidence, performing at the library@esplanade in 2017, the college's Official Opening ceremony in 2018 and community performances at St. Luke's Eldercare Centre. Her keen interest in the sciences as well as her passion for service, she served a short medical attachment with Parkway Hospitals to shadow and learn from different specialists. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">In between these endeavours, she balanced training across multiple CCA commitments. At the 'A' Division Games in 2017, she represented the college in Basketball (Girls) and attained medals in Swimming, going on to represent Singapore in the 2017 Southeast Asian Age Group Swimming Championships in Brunei. In the 2018 'A' Division Swimming Championships, she did the college proud by winning silver in the 50m Backstroke and 50m Freestyle events.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Earlier in 2018, I had juggle two CCAs, Swimming and Chinese Orchestra, and my duties as a Class Chairperson. At that point in time, I was struggling to keep up with my work: while focusing on my CCAs, I tried to fit in time to do some work when I could. It was only closer to the A-Levels that I started to ramp up, and planning my time really helped. I like to see everything organised and structured and having a plan helped to keep my focus in the lead-up to the exams. Maybe I could have done better at the start of the year. While we will all experience difficulties - nothing is ever easy - but we definitely need a little push and self-belief to overcome our difficulties and achieve our goals.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Megan Heng (17-A5)</strong> is the recipient of the distinguished Harvard Prize Book (Singapore). Beyond placing twice on the Dean's List (Academic) in 2017 and 2018, Megan was an exemplary student who was a positive influence on her peers. Appointed as a mentor-buddy, she helped a new student adapt into her class and as the Class Vice-Chairperson, fostered encouraging friendships within her civics group. Under the college's GLIDE Talent Development Programme, she assisted residents at various Meet-the-People sessions with their issues and embarked on a separate mental health awareness project with her GLIDE team. Megan's heart for the community led her to participate in a range of service learning projects at the Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped and TOUCH Community Services, distributing food to the home-bound in Ang Mo Kio and going the extra mile to know them on a personal level.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Law Yue Tian (17-A5)</strong> is a recipient of the MOE Pre-University Scholarship. Displaying commendable leadership in her role as a General Paper representative, she motivated her classmates in the subject and always offered a listening ear as a friend during stressful periods. She represented the college at the Pre-University Seminar in 2017 as a Social Engagement Activity coordinator, organising an outreach session in the Clementi neighbourhood. Passionate about serving and giving back to the community, she volunteered to coach students in life skills and in their homework under Nurture Programme 2.0 and embarked on a service learning journey to Sri Lanka as part of the Eunoia Global Orientation programme. An equally talented performer and a common sight on stage, Yue Tian also represented the college in Youth Got Talent!, a youth talent competition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Clyde Lhui (17-A5)</strong> is a gem of a student, his passion for learning and quick-witted intelligence illuminating his classmates and teachers alike. A budding scientist, Clyde wrote and presented a VisualBasic programme to predict blast damage at the Young Defence Scientists Programme Congress in 2017, represented the college in the Singapore Physics Olympiad and QCamp 2018 organised by the NUS Centre for Quantum Technologies. Clyde was an avid member of the college's Media Club, contributing many delightful snapshots of college life and dutifully improving AV duty processes. His passion extends to the Japanese language, teaching fellow Eunoians the language at the college's Unconference Day. Clyde's desire to serve others saw him volunteer as a tutor to underprivileged children. Clyde is in many ways an unsung hero who brings together intellectual capacity and a zest for life.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Megan:</strong>  Being consistent is important because everyone knows how much work there is to do, and how we always have other commitments such as CCAs and volunteer work. So try to complete as much as possible, read and understand the lecture notes as much as possible. I think we have been very fortunate because our teachers are very supportive and very encouraging. We are not only able to learn from them, we are also able to talk about our life issues and they can relate to us. That really helped us a lot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Yue Tian: </strong>For me, consultations really helped me cope with Economics and General Paper. As General Paper involves a lot of writing, you'd want your tutor to look through your work and give you comments. Despite our tutor's heavy workload, she was always willing to give individual and group consultations, and I am very thankful for that. To our juniors, you need to find out where you are struggling early and ask your tutors for help early.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Clyde: </strong>I think I took a more unconventional route. During my four years at Catholic High, I was more focused on learning the content and did not worry so much about exams. Looking back at my JC life, you need to know yourself, know where you are lacking and then what content you are not well-versed in. You do not always have to follow what everybody else is doing: it's more about understanding how you can improve yourself, and how you can better master the skills and content before you.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Yue Tian:</strong>  For me, it would be planning Orientation. While we missed many lessons to host activities, I made a lot of friends across classes, and I got to talk to juniors and influence them to make the best use of their 2 years in JC.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Clyde:</strong>  The highlight for me was being in Media Club, a CCA where I made many friends and gained a lot of skills. It was an outlet for me, something I could do in my free time and learn new knowledge in. It was nice to be in a community of learning, and going out on photo-runs and doing AV duty - even if it sounds boring - were actually fun. I felt that it made my JC life a lot more meaningful. It gave my JC life a purpose: to record what happened in school and preserve the memories I made along the way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Megan:</strong>  I think in my two years here, what mattered to me most was the whole process, and the small things - the 30 minute breaks between lessons, where you'll be rushing to the canteen to eat, and then rushing to the next venue - and also the many events we had in school, which really enriched our school culture and made learning even more fun.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Form support groups. Journeying alone over the two years is not only tough but meaningless. The friendships I have forged here not only supported me on my darkest days, but also made this journey worth the while.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Start early. I cannot emphasise this enough! Every day leading up to the A-Levels is a chance to add to your preparation. Give your undivided attention at lectures and tutorials. All the best!</span></p>

This will help you manage exam stress better. That being said, always allocate time for your class, CCA, and friends. Although results are undeniably important, your memories of the people you achieved those results with will be even more valuable. </span></p>

This helped me to sharpen my answering techniques substantially over a short period of time. Content-wise, writing detailed notes in different colours was my prefered method of studying. Representing information in an organised manner that I understood clearly has been particularly helpful in content heavy subjects like Physics and Chemistry. Also, sleeping early is extremely important! Always ensure that you get enough rest before the papers.</span></p>

Most of the time, it is our mindsets that hold us back, so in order to be better, you need to believe that you can be better, and sometimes all it takes is to ‘fake it till you make it’. Never lose sight of your end goal and constantly push yourself regardless of your current performance. Encourage yourself to work even harder nearing the A-Levels, but take occasional breaks such that you do not burn out prematurely.</span></p>

Both alumnae from Singapore Chinese Girls' School, they matriculated as Eunoians through two different pathways. Faith joined the college via the Joint Admissions Exercise as an O-Level Programme student and Grace was admitted via the Joint Integrated Programme. Faith was a student in the Arts stream, and Grace was a Science stream student.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Faith was an industrious and preternaturally curious student who stretched herself in diverse fields. She demonstrated her flair for English in the World Youth Essay Competition, joined the Eunoia Global Orientation programme trip to Chongqing and Chengdu in China, participated in the National Healthcare Medical Symposium and won an internal poetry competition with her entry based on the theme of 'Unity'. She continued to pursue her passion in music, performing alongside Grace in a recital at library@esplanade in 2017 and clinching a silver award in the Performers' Music Festival in 2018. Faith was also instrumental in the formation of the EJC Student Ambassadors corps and is part of a group seeking to establish the college's alumni association.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Grace was an exemplary student in the college's Music Elective Programme (MEP), performing at a national MEP outreach event held at the National Gallery Singapore and at a dance showcase for tertiary institutions at the Singapore Dance Theatre. She is also a talented dancer who choreographed and performed at numerous school events including the inaugural College Day in 2017. Alongside her academic achievements and placing on the Dean's List (Academic), she served as the Head of Press in EJC Media, and is a founding member of Eunoia Origin, an online student voice publication.</span></p>

I think it's a marathon not for a single person but many people together. I am really grateful to have my friends, my classmates, fellow Eunoians from the Arts stream, and everyone just being there for me and walking through the journey together. There were subjects like History that were very content heavy and very abstract concepts that we couldn't immediately grasp in Literature but together we pulled our resources together and we helped each other to achieve what we could not have achieved by ourselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Grace</strong>: I would say it is like a rollercoaster - full of ups and downs.

You may be tired and wary from tests and examinations, but it is important to know your own performance and learn to do better the next time.

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Eunoia Junior College congratulates our First Class of students for their outstanding achievement at the 2018 GCE A-Level Examination. Coming together from the Joint Integrated Programme, Direct School Admission and Joint Admissions Exercise pathways, they have shone brightly as the change makers and pioneers of the college. They have truly made history and created a great legacy for their juniors to carry forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">The college is extremely proud of all 529 Eunoians who sat the 2018 GCE A-Level Examination. 1 in 2 Eunoians attained at least 3 H2 distinctions, with 1 in 3 scoring 5 distinctions or more and 94 Eunoians scoring 6 distinctions or more. In addition, 1 in 2 students achieved a distinction in their H3 subjects. The cohort achieved a median University Admissions Score (UAS) of 85 rank points.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Our combined total of 80 scholars from the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese), Humanities Scholarship Programme and Music Elective Programme, our MOE Pre-University Scholars, international scholars, book prize and scholarship recipients have set a tradition of excellence for the college with their stellar results.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Amongst the many milestones for our first cohort, our Eunoians have to date received conditional offers from distinguished institutions including Oxford University and Peking University, and provisional offers of scholarships such as the Public Service Commission scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Defence Merit Scholarship. The college eagerly anticipates more good news from our Eunoians in the coming months.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Above and beyond their lustrous academic results, every Eunoian from our First Class has excelled holistically as a Youth with Purpose, Thinker with Heart and Leader with Courage. Within a few months of intensive practice, our inaugural cohort of performing arts CCAs clinched the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2017 in the Dance and Concert Band categories. This was followed by another outstanding showing in Drama at the SYF Arts Presentation in 2018. Our student-athletes represented Singapore at the Asian Youth Games and ASEAN School Games, while also attaining a very commendable 2nd and 3rd place in the ‘A’ Division Hockey (Girls) and Netball championships in 2018. In various academic competitions and olympiads, our Eunoians also paved the way in our first years to even greater successes and wins in the near future. Most importantly, our First Class served as writers of the Eunoia story, handing over a school culture future generations of Eunoians are proud to call their own.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Mrs Kellie Woo, the Dean of our 2018 JC2 cohort, shared her heartfelt thoughts, ‘I am extremely proud of our pioneering cohort, who have been with Eunoia every step of the journey, some from as early as 2013. From being orientation leaders for their own batch to starting CCAs from scratch, they truly created Eunoia's legacy. The First Class indeed holds a very special place in all our hearts. Today we not only celebrate their holistic achievements but also the Eunoia identity that they have created.'</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Mrs Wong-Cheang Mei Heng, Principal, added, ‘We are proud of our Eunoians’ achievements and all-rounded development. The A-Level result is but one step in the lifelong learning journey of our pioneer students. In many ways their growth and development have been defined by the college culture they have pioneered, the college spirit they have fostered, the friendships they have built, and the cognitive sharpness they have developed. While their A-Level results open doors to possibilities in their next journey, they are ultimately not defined by their grades and certificates but by who they are as a person and what impact they leave on others.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">As one Eunoia, we celebrate the holistic achievements and contributions of our First Class. The college would like to extend its deepest gratitude to our teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, our College Advisory Committee, Joint Integrated Programme partner schools and all who have made the Eunoia dream a reality. May our First Class spread their beautiful thinking and goodwill far and wide, and shine brightly as thinkers, leaders, and Eunoians forevermore.</span></p>
